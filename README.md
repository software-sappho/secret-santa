# 🎅 The Peer-to-Peer Santa Hackathon Challenge 🎅

Welcome to the **Peer-to-Peer Santa Hackathon Challenge**! This project was created as part of a 24-hour hackathon event🎁✨  What you’re about to witness is less a piece of software and more so a desperate cry for help! But it exists, and now it’s here for you to see- a gift of code that might just fall apart if you look at it too hard.

## 🎯 Project Goals
This application is designed to:
1. **Assign gift exchanges**🎁: Randomly determine who gifts whom, ensuring no one gifts themselves (because that's just awkward). 🎉
2. **Be public and shareable**🌐: Hosted here on GitHub, a repository of both code and regrets. ✨
3. **Be delivered on time**⏰: Completed before the hackathon deadline. Because if I’m going to fail, I’d rather fail punctually than ambitiously.

## 🌟 Bonus Features
- A **pretty and polished user interface** 🎨 to distract you from any bugs! ✨
- **Gift suggestions** to save you from last-minute socks. 🧦

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: [Go] 🐹 (chosen not out of preference but out of sheer necessity to make something work).

## 🎄 Getting Started
I don’t know if you want to get started with this. Honestly, I don’t even know if I recommend it, but here:

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Go].
2. Clone this repository, I guess:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/peer-to-peer-santa.git
   cd peer-to-peer-santa
   ```
   
3. Run it:
```bash
go run main.go
:
OR
:
go run .
```

## Instructions

Once localhost:8080 grinds to life, you can only use 4 names:

```bash
Anna, Bob, Charlie, David 
```
I know it's not a lot of options but... actually there is no but, it sucks. Why? Because I gave up.
   
## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Please don't look at my commit history and .github folder. This project was pushed on a laptop so ancient, it might start running Windows XP if I breathe on it wrong. I’m genuinely afraid to push its limits, just let me die. Thank you for your understanding and your patience with my prehistoric hardware!💾

# 🌟 Acknowledgements
This project was made possible by:

The festive spirit of the Zone01 Cohort, who somehow kept me from giving up on life altogether.🎄

Imichalop, who, by assigning this challenge, gently pushed me into the abyss of self-loathing and regret. 💻✨

Have a merry coding season, and may the Secret Santa algorithm bless you! 🎅🎁
