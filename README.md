# 🎅 The Peer-to-Peer Santa Hackathon Challenge 🎅

Welcome to the **Peer-to-Peer Santa Hackathon Challenge**! This project was created as part of a 24-hour hackathon event to spread holiday cheer through code. 🎁✨

## 🎯 Project Goals
This application is designed to:
1. **Assign gift exchanges**: Randomly determine who gives a gift to whom within a group, ensuring no one gifts themselves. 🎉
2. **Be public and shareable**: Hosted on a public GitHub repository for all to enjoy. 🌐
3. **Deliver on time**: Completed before the hackathon deadline.

## 🌟 Bonus Features
We’ve added a touch of magic to the app:
- A **pretty and polished user interface** to enhance the festive experience. 🎨
- **Gift suggestions** to inspire your inner Santa. 🎁

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: [Go]

## 🎄 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Go].
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/peer-to-peer-santa.git
   cd peer-to-peer-santa```
   
3. Run the application:
```bash
go run main.go
:
OR
:
go run .
```

### Instructions

Once localhost:8080 loads, you can only use 4 names:

```bash
Anna, Bob, Charlie, David 
```
I know it's not a lot of options but... actually there is no but it sucks.
   
## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Please don't look at my commit history and .github folder. This project was pushed on a laptop so ancient that it might qualify for a museum display. I’m genuinely afraid to push its limits, just let me die. Thank you for your understanding and your patience with my prehistoric hardware! 🖥️💾
