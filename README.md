# 🎅 The Peer-to-Peer Santa Hackathon Challenge 🎅

Welcome to the **Peer-to-Peer Santa Hackathon Challenge**! This project was created as part of a 24-hour hackathon event to spread holiday cheer through code. 🎁✨

## 🎯 Project Goals
This application is designed to:
1. **Assign gift exchanges**: Randomly determine who gives a gift to whom within a group, ensuring no one gifts themselves. 🎉
2. **Be public and shareable**: Hosted on a public GitHub repository for all to enjoy. 🌐
3. **Deliver on time**: Completed before the hackathon deadline.

## 🌟 Bonus Features
We’ve added a touch of magic to the app:
- A **pretty and polished user interface** to enhance the festive experience. 🎨
- **Gift suggestions** to inspire your inner Santa. 🎁

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: [Go]
